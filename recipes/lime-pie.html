    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>I hope you all enjoy this Key lime pie. When I moved from Lebanon to Florida in the spring of 1999,
       the famous Key lime pie was new to me. It was a friend's favorite dessert so I kept playing with the recipe to get that wow flavor. I now live in North Bay, Ontario, where we only get Key limes twice a year, 
       so sometimes I substitute them with fresh lime juice.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <h3>Crust:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>⅔ cup toasted slivered almonds</li>
        <li>1 cup graham cracker crumbs</li>
        <li>¼ cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 pinch salt</li>
        <li>¼ cup butter, melted</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Key Lime Filling</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 (14 ounce) can sweetened condensed milk</li>
        <li>¾ cup cold heavy cream</li>
        <li>4 large egg yolks</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon grated lime zest</li>
        <li>½ cup Key lime juice</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).</li>
        <li>To make the crust: Pulse almonds in a food processor until finely ground, then pour into a medium bowl. Add graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and salt. Pour in melted butter and mix until evenly moistened. Press into a 9-inch pie plate.</li>
        <li>Bake in the preheated oven until crust is golden brown, 10 to 13 minutes.</li>
        <li>While crust is baking, make the filling: Beat condensed milk, cream, egg yolks, and lime zest in a large bowl until well combined. Whisk in lime juice, a little at a time, to thicken custard. Pour custard into pie crust.</li>
        <li>Bake until custard is set, about 15 minutes. Cool to room temperature on a wire rack, then cover loosely with plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 8 hours to overnight.</li>
    </ol>
